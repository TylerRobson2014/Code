occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would

affected by multiple vulnerabilities.","The remote Windows host has a version of the Microsoft .NET Framework
that is affected by multiple vulnerabilities :

  - A information disclosure vulnerability exists in the
    .NET Framework due to improper DTD parsing of crafted
    XML files. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can
    exploit this, via a malicious application file, to gain
    read access to the local files on the system.
    (CVE-2015-6096)

  - An cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in ASP.NET
    due to improper validation of values in HTTP requests.
    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    inject arbitrary script into the user's browser session.
    (CVE-2015-6099)

  - A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in the
    .NET Framework due to improper implementation of the
    Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) feature. An
